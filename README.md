# gpu-image-acceleration
Modern image processing pipelines often rely on GPU acceleration, but the benefits are highly dependent on workload size and memory transfer costs. This project aims to provide a clear, experimental comparison between CPU and GPU approaches, helping practitioners understand when GPU acceleration is truly advantageous.
